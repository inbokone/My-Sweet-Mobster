Also, clean up the blood on the floor.

00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,250
To the left? What cat?

69
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,050
It's a blast in here!

70
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,389
You said it was urgent, so I didn't even get changed.

71
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,160
I thought something had happened to you.

72
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,290
But a club?

73
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,860
Forget it. I'm leaving.

74
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,959
What? Hold on.

75
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,329
Darn it.

76
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,100
What is she wearing that...

77
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,740
Hey. I bet you thought I had left.

78
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,100
How did you get in,

79
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,310
- dressed like that? - There's always a way.

80
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,439
Go home.

81
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,040
- Just this once. - Beat it.

82
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,089
It's a surprise.

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,689
It is shocking, I give you that.

84
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,629
I needed a cape anyway, so it's a win-win.

85
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:01,660
That cost me ten dollars.

86
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,990
I'm keeping that as a prop.

87
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,730
Where do you think you're going?

88
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,959
To dance. I didn't get past the bouncer for kicks, you know.

89
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,029
Seriously.

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,139
Would you like to be splashed all over the news tomorrow?

91
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,199
Right, the cape.

92
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,069
I'm off to the restroom.

93
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,800
Boss, Taek wasn't at the warehouse.

94
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,500
It seems as though he's back on drugs.

95
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,450
Gosh, I'm sorry.

96
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,590
Wait, my back.

97
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,759
Thank you.

98
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,289
Goodness.

99
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,269
Can you watch your feet?

100
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,000
Not there! There's one over there.

101
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:54,669
Thank you.

102
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,149
Boss, Seo Ji Hwan is here.

103
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,690
Darn it.

104
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,200
What brings you by, Ji Hwan?

105
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,730
This isn't a place for just about anyone.

106
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,470
I'm sure you know Jung Yoon Taek.

107
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,940
Who's Jung Yoon Taek?

108
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,980
I don't know that name.

109
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,210
There are too many people around to know who's who.

110
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,559
You can't take that.

111
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,289
Did you lace it with something special?

112
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,940
Ji Hwan, come on.

113
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,070
We only added love and trust.

114
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,580
You fell and cost me...

115
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,250
an expensive bottle of whiskey.

116
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,950
- My gosh. - What's going on?

117
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,519
- What is he doing? - What's his problem?

118
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,389
- Oh, no. - This is terrible.

119
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,789
Stop beating up your employee.

120
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,759
- What on earth? - My gosh.

121
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,970
I can't believe it.

122
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,470
- My gosh. - That was insane.

123
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,379
What is it? What's going on?

124
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,250
That guy...

125
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,320
Gosh, I'm sorry.

126
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,389
Wait, my back.

127
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,789
Thank you.

128
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,289
What?

129
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:00,460
Hey, let's get out of here.

130
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,200
- Come on. Let's leave. - Hey!

131
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,769
No!

132
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,379
- It's the police. - The police?

133
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,080
- Gosh, no. - I'm not the police.

134
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,320
- I'm not. - Intervene, will you?

135
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,679
- Go on. - The police?

136
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,120
Well...

137
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,389
Please put that down.

138
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:30,059
- What? - Put it down.

139
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not what you think.

140
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,200
Get him up.

141
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,470
Right.

142
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,940
What... What are you doing?

143
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,539
You have the right to remain silent...

144
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:43,809
and have the right to an attorney.

145
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:47,179
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

146
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,509
You psycho.

147
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,649
Just a second. So you're a police officer.

148
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,580
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

149
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,919
You cannot cuff me without a warrant,

150
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,360
so take these off.

151
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,330
Without a warrant, you can't...

152
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:08,330
Bedazzled shoes?

153
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,240
May I see your ID?

154
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,240
My ID? Well, that...

155
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,049
I left it in my car.

156
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:25,850
One's ID isn't like a rabbit's liver,

157
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,149
so why leave it in your car?

158
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,549
You don't even have your badge either.

159
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,519
You're not real police, are you?

160
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,789
- Hey. - Wait.

161
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,259
- What kind of a joke is this? - Over here!

162
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,759
Help us. Over here.

163
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,529
- Gosh. - Coming through.

164
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,299
- Over here. - Over here.

165
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:42,370
We're coming through.

166
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,539
Please help. Over here.

167
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,799
Excuse us.

168
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,440
- Please be patient. - Excuse us.

169
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,269
- Coming through. Sorry. - What on earth?

170
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,440
Sorry about this.

171
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,580
Unbelievable.

Tell me about it.

His haughty attitude...

176
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,250
- made me lose it. - We apologize.

that you had to promote the play set.

It slipped your mind?

The play set...

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,910
Darn. I should've smacked him harder.

340
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,259
What?

341
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,630
I hope you paid for those.

342
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,430
Lock the door whenever possible when going to the restroom.

343
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,900
Or else, you'll turn kids into thieves.

344
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,900
Let them take whatever they want if there are any.

345
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,869
Having nothing is the problem, not having them.

346
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,339
Stealing from this place alone won't be a problem.

347
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,450
But they say he who steals an egg steals a cow.

348
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,079
Really? But there are those who start off by stealing cows.

349
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,059
Must you hurt me first thing in the morning?

350
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,230
How are you these days?

351
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,170
Everyone in town seems to be struggling.

352
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,369
It was better when you were here.

353
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,980
That does not mean you did well.

354
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,980
I know better than anyone else that I did nothing well.

355
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,519
It's nothing new.

356
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,420
Look at you. You've matured.

357
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,619
You know what you've done wrong.

358
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:35,259
Ji Hwan. You're ready to get married now.

359
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:37,930
Are you trying to ruin someone's life?

360
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,160
Especially when I'm finally starting off with a clean slate.

361
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,940
Since we're on the subject, I'll set you up with a girl.

362
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,609
The owner of the side dish place...

363
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,740
across the street has a daughter.

364
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,980
I heard she was 30 or 31 years old this year.

365
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,950
Apparently, she got a divorce last year.

366
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,549
But she has no kids.

367
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:03,589
What is it?

368
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,789
Did her divorce make you lose interest in her?

369
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,559
If she's that nice, introduce her to your grandson.

370
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,660
Oh, goodness. My grandson has already found a girl...

371
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,369
and has three kids.

372
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:23,309
It's okay to live like my grandson now.

373
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,410
The guys I have right now are enough of a hassle.

374
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,880
I'm leaving.

375
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,980
- What? - Put it on my tab.

376
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,250
Good grief.

377
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,849
Really.

378
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,470
Being bad at math is the very reason you can't get married!

379
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,269
Take a facial mask.

380
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:59,210
It's made with bamboo sap, not soju.

381
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,940
Take a facial mask.

382
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,210
It's made with bamboo sap, not soju.

383
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,619
- Soju! - Take a facial mask.

384
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,279
- I love soju. - Is that so?

385
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,220
- Let me give you a hug. - Sir.

386
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,049
I'm not your beloved, sir.

387
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,390
- Just a hug. Please. - Stop it.

388
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,529
It's just one hug.

389
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,730
No. Please leave with this facial mask.

390
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,000
Here. Take a facial mask.

391
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
It's made with bamboo sap,

392
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,869
- not soju. - Soju?

393
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,039
It's our tenth-anniversary event.

394
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:30,140
Good gracious. Keep this up, and I'll call the police, sir!

395
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,410
"The police?"

396
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:34,309
- My son-in-law is a policeman. - Seriously.

397
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,809
Stay still.

398
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,519
Fooled you.

399
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:54,500
(10th Anniversary Event)

400
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,109
Take a facial mask.

401
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,509
- It's made with bamboo sap. - You...

402
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:07,779
- Take a... - You!

403
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,259
Stop right there!

404
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,170
Defensive gloves on!

405
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,799
Mini power!

406
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,630
Wait.

407
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,269
Seriously.

408
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,069
Darn it. For goodness' sake.

409
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,309
Gosh.

410
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:16,779
Why not act like a police officer again?

411
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,950
You hit the back of my head earlier, right?

412
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:23,990
- Are you a member of Kitty Gang? - What cat?

413
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,789
I knew it.

414
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:28,490
No wonder you acted like a police officer and helped him out.

415
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,059
- Back then, I... - Who gave you the goods?

416
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,400
Sorry? What goods?

417
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,930
The red, yellow, and blue thing you gave out at the club.

418
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,500
"Red, yellow, and blue thing? At the club?"

419
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,640
(Peek-a-boo!)

420
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,410
Yes, that drug.

421
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,549
"Drug?"

422
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,380
Those aren't drugs but snacks for kids.

423
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,279
Stop lying. I know all about it.

424
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,089
I'm sorry to cut you off, but I have no time to waste.

425
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,319
I'm truly sorry.

426
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
Goodness.

427
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,460
Answer me before you go.

428
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,130
But I know nothing to answer your question.

429
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,869
Follow me, and I'll give you some of that drug.

430
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,299
(Oasis)

431
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
Ma'am.

432
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,279
I've experienced all sorts of part-time workers.

433
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,509
But playing hooky like you is a first.

434
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:23,980
I'm sorry. I'll get back to work.

435
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,349
"Get back to work?" After all the mess you've made?

436
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:29,319
Leave. And you're not getting paid for today.

437
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,619
Ma'am. Wait, ma'am.

438
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,420
I'll work right away. I can do it.

439
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,529
Ma'am?

440
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Gosh.

441
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,140
(The Greatest)

442
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,190
I really can't believe this.

443
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,259
Hey. You.

444
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,170
What are you doing?

445
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Hey...

446
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,740
Are you crazy? Spit it out!

447
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,880
Spit it out!

448
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,539
You'll die, you know?

449
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,349
Has this woman gone mad or something?

450
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,950
Do you have a death wish?

451
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,420
What is it?

452
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,789
Did it get stuck in your throat?

453
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:45,900
Did it?

454
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,230
Come on. Spit it out.

455
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,130
Spit it out already!

456
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,500
Spit it out. Come on.

457
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,069
Spit it out.

458
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,839
Spit it out!

459
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:07,220
Water! Hurry up!

460
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,420
Water! Here!

461
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,839
You punk!

462
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,410
You should've called me over if there was such a spectacle.

463
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,779
You were dining with Mr. Park.

464
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,920
He won't die overnight. I could've met him next time.

465
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,250
Perch could've waited.

466
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,619
I'm happy right now. Very happy.

467
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,460
It's a bummer I couldn't witness Seo Ji Hwan...

468
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,930
get humiliated in person.

469
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,329
Kang Gil. There's CCTV footage of it, right?

470
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:01,240
My apologies. We got rid of it just in case.

471
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,470
You little...

472
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Did you erase it?

473
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,180
I'm the owner of this place, so why?

474
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,549
It wasn't your call to erase it.

475
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,619
You punk.

476
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,119
My apologies.

477
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,819
I'm sorry.

478
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,759
I'm sorry, okay?

479
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:25,900
Don't erase it next time.

480
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,500
Watching it before bed...

481
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,470
will help me sleep like a baby.

482
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,869
It could get bad if he digs deeper.

483
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:37,869
Do we still let him be?

484
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,210
Let him try. He left the dogfight pit.

485
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,880
It won't take long until he stops.

486
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes!

487
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,390
If he doesn't stop,

488
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,730
we can simply throw him a treat.

489
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:00,799
The results are negative.

490
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,670
- Mr. Kim Byung Heon. This way. - Yes.

491
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,640
I told you they weren't drugs. They were kids' snacks.

492
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,549
Why did you have to drag me all the way here?

493
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:22,420
Then why on earth did you act like...

494
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,990
a police officer that day?

495
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,289
You shouldn't beat up a person like that.

496
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,029
So, I...

497
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,200
Well...

498
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,670
Do you think a guy like me, who beats a man to a pulp,

499
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,329
won't beat up a woman?

500
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:42,940
This is my territory.

501
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,769
If you beat me up,

502
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,309
the others will do the same to you.

503
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:48,849
Listen carefully.

504
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,049
If you're reckless...

505
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,349
and brainless, you'll end up with a broken skull.

506
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,490
Unless you want that to happen,

507
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,059
don't ever come near a person like me.

508
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,059
Keep a distance of at least 50m. Understood?

509
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,529
- "Brainless?" - Keep a 50m distance.

510
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:07,900
That was a bit harsh.

511
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,130
Run away 50m.

512
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:12,700
I clearly told you those weren't...

513
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,769
- A 50m distance! - Okay!

514
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,140
Gosh. He must be crazy.

515
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,109
What? Drugs?

516
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,480
Yes. He thought the kids' snacks were drugs.

517
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,650
Hold on. Wasn't he a real thug...

518
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,990
if he also did drugs?

519
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,049
Are you sure?

520
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,490
Of course. I've seen more than dozens since we were kids.

521
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,089
So why did you have to go to the dumpling store?

522
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:37,329
Right, the dumpling store.

523
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,059
- Gosh. - Seriously.

524

with the name "Hyun Woo."

526
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,170
- It's so good. - It is, right?

527
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,309
I told you.

528
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:52,509

531
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,509
Welcome. How much do you need?

532
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,519
Sorry?

533
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:03,150
Oh, I came to meet this guy named Hyun Woo.

534
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,650
Look over there.

535
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,119

There was a time you talked to a random guy...

545
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,720
who tortured you for a month.

546
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,990
- Stop. - Excuse me?

547

She has a pure spirit.

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,420
- Hold on. - Welcome.

00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,890
- Hi. - Hi.

00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,460
Oh, I remember.

551
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:45,700
I got mistaken for an adulteress...

552
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,759
and almost got into huge trouble.

553

00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,109
You!

559
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:58,710
I thought you were behaving yourself these days.

560
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,779
- That's not it. - Honey!

561
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,109
- I so knew it! - Wait.

562
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,049
No. I'm innocent, honey. I swear.

563

Yes, I remember.

565
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,619
That did happen.

566
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:12,159
It's like finding a guy with the last name "Smith"...

among thousands of people.

568
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,460
At least Smith is a last name.

569
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,030
But I know his first name. Isn't it a similar situation?

570
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,800
Seriously? Are you saying that for real?

571
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,400
I've only ever called him by his first name,

572
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,230
so it's impossible to recall his last name.

573
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,639
He could've had a unique first name, at least.

574
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,539
Gosh, I don't even know if he's dead or alive.

575
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,380
It's been 23 years since I last heard from him.

576
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,550
I'd be more than grateful knowing he's alive and well...

of guiding the people to the right path?

Right.

589
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:10,969
Let's see. You beat up your church believers...

590
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:14,610
because they didn't pay tithe or Lord's Day Collection properly.

591
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,610
Oh, that?

592
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:19,719
I simply taught them that those are the basics...

593
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,480
for the followers of the Lord.

594
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,349
You calculated the tithe as monthly compound interest.

595
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,559
And at 40 percent instead of the maximum legal interest...

596
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,130
of 20 percent.

597
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,789
The tithe is paid voluntarily...

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,559
- by the believers. - In this business,

599
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,860
you had the church elders involved.

600

601

Jung Yoon Taek, in charge of the Hanam warehouse,

went missing before his probation ended.

It's as expected from a druggie.

He couldn't hold back and turned to drugs again, no?

wanting to earn money earnestly...

he asked for simple jobs like managing the warehouse.

00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:53,980
It's nice and lovely in here.

836
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,239
Why don't you read a magazine like me?

837
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,280
You're holding it upside down.

838
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:00,449
(Where is Cusen where Chairman Lim is a regular?)

839
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,690
Excuse me. Do you have a girlfriend?

840
00:48:14,429 --> 00:48:16,969
I'm working right now, so I'll let you know after work.

841
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,000
I see.

842
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:20,869
Then, here.

843
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,860
What's your secret?

844
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,389
- My face. - I knew you'd say that.

845
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,760
You're early.

846
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,599
I'm late because I had other stuff.

847
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:54,900
No problem. It's all right.

848
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,809
Was it Thirsty Pig?

849
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:00,679
It's "Deer."

850
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:02,679
"Deer?"

851
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,079
You don't sell venison, though.

852
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,019
That's a funny name.

853
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,860
We talked about it.

854
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,530
But our department store...

855
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,500
can't work with you.

856
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,630
One time, we displayed a problematic product,

857
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,500
which almost led to a boycott.

858
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,570
Is there any problem with our products?

859
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Don't get me wrong. Your products are fine.

860
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,110
How they taste isn't the problem.

861
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,119
Goodness.

862
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:45,690
If the people who make them...

863
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,619
are the problem, we have a problem. don't we?

864
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,929
I was going to play nice, but this is too much.

865
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,500
- Do you think food is a joke? - Oh, no.

866
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,059
What's wrong with our products?

867
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,170
Did our sausages commit a crime?

868
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,170
Hey. Are you proud that you've been to jail, then?

869
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,170
"Proud?"

870
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,440
- You know nothing about pride. - Come here.

871
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,409
- Let go. - Just because I'm an ex-con?

872
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:08,539
You know nothing about pride, punk.

873
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,079
- Why are you crying? - Darn it.

874
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,280
If I let this go, you're dead meat.

875
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,719
- Let go, then. - Please talk it out.

876
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,880
- I don't want to kill anyone. - You're an ex-con, anyway.

877
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,320
Ex-cons love...

878
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,789
to quote about the thirsty deer.

879
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:22,260
If you're not thirsty, are you an angel, then?

880
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,289
What are you talking about?

881
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,159
Stop talking nonsense.

882
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,860
Do you understand it now, punk?

883
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,960
- Do you think I do? - Are you kidding me?

884
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,030
- Hey. - Please let it go.

885
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,539
Okay, everyone. Get ready to clap.

886
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,309
Clap three times. "I love you."

887
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,980
What?

888
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:44,610
We'll try it one more time.

889
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,519
Clap three times. "I love you."

890
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,420
- I love you. - I love you.

891
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,489
Great job, kids.

892
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:53,019
This time, only the grown-ups will do it.

893
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:56,389
Clap three times. "I am sorry."

894
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,699
What? They have to let go of each other to clap, right?

895
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:05,000
You should stop. Kids are watching.

896
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,599
- That's right. - Stop it.

897
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,840
- What are they doing? - They are watching.

898
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,269
- It's nothing. - Clap three times.

899
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:12,940
- "Patch things up." - Right.

900
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,110
- Patch things up. - Patch things up.

901
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,179
- Patch things up. - Patch things up.

902
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,409
- Okay. - Patch things up.

903
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,050
- Patch things up. - This is...

904
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,980
- For goodness' sake. - Darn it.

905
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,719
Are you belittling me because I'm a lefty?

906
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:27,019
- Punk. - Hold on.

907
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:32,960
Okay. Let's call it off, then.

908
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:34,559
Yes.

909
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,030
We distribute our products to 11 hotels...

910
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,900
and about 80 major supermarkets.

911
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,670
Consumer perception has changed,

912
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,099
so our sales aren't that low either.

913
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,869
Our repurchase rate is much higher than other products.

914
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,639
I think our Frank line...

915
00:51:47,639 --> 00:51:49,480
comes with consumers' trust in the brand.

916
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:56,789
I'm sorry. He said something about trust.

917
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,889
I couldn't hold my laughter.

918
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:04,530
They say, "When you cook, your hands should be clean."

919
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,599
It's because you don't want germs in your food.

920
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:10,570
To be honest,

921
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:13,300
I don't want our customers...

922
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:16,039
to have the food...

923
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,739
made with dirty hands.

924
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,780
Your chairman is a regular of Cusen, right?

925
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,280
He loves charcuterie.

926
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,619
Yes, that's right. I'm surprised you know that.

927
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:32,050
Of everything, he loves jamon, the whole hind leg of pork...

928
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,460
dry-cured in salt,

929
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:37,130
and prosciutto, the slices of a wild boar's thigh...

930
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,900
that has been salted and dry-cured.

931
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,630
How did you know all that?

932
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,329
It was written in here.

933
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:46,800
(Where is Cusen where Chairman Lim is a regular?)

934
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,070
(Wine and charcuterie)

935
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,070
(Jamon, prosciutto)

936
00:52:51,409 --> 00:52:52,409
I see.

937
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,840
Mr. Kim Seung Joon.

938
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:58,449
(Kim Seung Joon, Chief, Yeojin Department Store)

939
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,980
The supplier for Cusen...

940
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:03,920
is us.

941
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,889
(Supplied by Thirsty Deer)

942
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:07,420
(Laughing)

943
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,159
Mr. Joo.

944
00:53:14,099 --> 00:53:15,900
- Yes, sir. - Let's go.

945
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,949
(Entrance to Yeojin Department Store)

946
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:30,949
Okay.

947
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,619
Sir.

948
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:35,949
I think we have a problem.

949
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:40,159
Gosh. Why did you have to get into a fight?

950
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,519
Oh, that stings!

951
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,659
Dong Hui, be gentle.

952
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,730
Gosh. What a crybaby!

953
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,829
You are making a fuss,

954
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:50,630
but you got scratched just a tiny bit.

955
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,030
Hey, don't you know that the key to customer management is the face?

956
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,900
Really? Then...

957
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,570
the key to customer management is missing.

958
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:58,710
Maybe it's dead.

959
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:01,280
Don't you dare tell Big Boss about this.

960
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:02,639
If Boss Ji Hwan finds out...

961
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,909
If I find out, then what?

962
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:16,360
Good going.

963
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,059
I sent you to promote our products, but you got in a fight?

964
00:54:20,659 --> 00:54:23,570
Well... What brought you here?

965
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,570
I knew you'd be messing things up, so I came to check.

966
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,469
I shouldn't have come.

967
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,340
No, we didn't start it, Boss.

968
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,639
That's not the case, Boss.

969
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:34,880
He belittled us for being ex-convicts.

970
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,440
But aren't you an ex-con?

971
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:40,719
I am, but...

972
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,920
Never mind, Boss.

973
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,159
Have you forgotten because it's been a while?

974
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,719
Or are you confusing yourselves...

975
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,090
for normal company employees because you work like them?

976
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,199
Going to jail doesn't erase the fact that you committed crimes.

977
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,429
We got punished...

978
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,630
for not doing what others think is common sense.

979
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,210
If he reminded you of that so that you wouldn't forget it,

980
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,440
you should have thanked him.

981
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,880
Why grab him by his collar?

982
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,909
I'm sorry, Boss.

983
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,849
My old habits came out without meaning to.

984
00:55:17,789 --> 00:55:20,519
You had a rough day, so let's call it a day.

985
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:23,429
Let's have pork belly for dinner. Wrap it up.

986
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,760
Yes, Boss.

987
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,429
(Thirsty Deer's Sausages for Kids)

988
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,800
We'll wrap it up and leave, Boss.

989
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,230
Should I make a reservation at the black pork place?

990
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,199
- Wrap this up first. - Come here.

991
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:34,670
Now, we will begin...

992
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,039
the cooking class with Ms. Mini!

993
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:41,579
Today, we'll make something you like.

994
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:43,480
Ms. Mini loves it too.

995
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:46,849
We're going to make a pizza.

996
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:48,619
- It's a pizza. - It looks good.

997
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,449
Okay. With this fine flour,

998
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:54,119
why don't we make some stretchy dough?

999
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,630
After kneading, the dough became stretchy, right?

1000
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,659
- Yes. - Yes.

1001
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:02,530
Should we check how stretchy it got?

1002
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,269
- Yes. - Take a look.

1003
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:06,170
Okay.

1004
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:10,269
- Cool. - Amazing.

1005
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,570
- Director Lee! - Don't throw it at me!

1006
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:39,130
Stop it! Gosh!

1007
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,599
White snow is falling down.

1008

(Tasty playtime with Ms. Mini)

1009
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:46,570
- Here. - Hey!

1010
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,510
- It's snowing. - Don't throw it to me.

1011
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:51,349
It's flour!

1012
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:53,050
- Here. - Nice.

1013
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,619
It's snowing.

1014
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,079
It's snowing in the summer.

1015
00:56:57,619 --> 00:56:59,320
I told you not to throw it at me. Gosh.

1016
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,519
For goodness' sake. Don't do it.

1017
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,159
Eun Ha, you can't do this.

1018
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:04,590
That woman is...

1019
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,329
Guys!

1020
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,210
Here you go.

1021
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:34,679
- Here it comes. - Hey!

1022
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,489
Wasn't it fun today?

1023
00:58:45,989 --> 00:58:48,730
Sure. It was fun, indeed.

1024
00:58:51,969 --> 00:58:54,639
I'll go back after cleaning this place up.

1025
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:55,639
You can go first.

1026
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,670
Okay. Got it.

1027
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,409
(Tasty playtime with Ms. Mini)

1028
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,480
See you later.

1029
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,519
- Gosh. How long will it take? - Why aren't they coming out?

1030
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:18,530
(Restroom)

1031
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,639
Where did Boss Ji Hwan go?

1032
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,579
Is he using the restroom?

1033
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,050
He didn't look like he was going to the restroom.

1034
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,179
- He won't answer his phone either. - No?

1035
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,349
I'll ask around.

1036

Gosh. There's so much flour on the floor.

(Men's restroom)

1040

Restroom.

1041
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,739
Oh, no.

1042
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,250
Are you all right?

1043
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,809
Gosh. I'm sorry.

1044
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:23,550
What the heck?

1045
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,250
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were behind me.

1046
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,119
- It hurts, doesn't it? - It's okay.

1047
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:29,789
Wait. What should I do? Hold on.

1048
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:32,289
Try to straighten your body. Hold on.

1049
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,099
Do you want to hold this?

1050
01:01:36,099 --> 01:01:37,099
Yes?

1051
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,900
I'm sorry.

1052
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,570
- I'm sorry. - Boss.

1053
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,880
Big Boss. What are you doing?

1054
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,710
Wait.

1055
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,420
- Wait. - Oh, no.

1056
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:57,420
- What? - No.

1057
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,820
Here. Take my hand.

1058
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,929
If you're reckless...

1059
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,670
and brainless, you'll end up with a broken skull.

1060
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:15,070
Don't ever come near a person like me.

1061
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:17,940
Keep a distance of at least 50m. Understood?

1062
01:02:18,039 --> 01:02:19,110
A 50m distance!

Oh, no!

- Boss. - Oh, gosh!

1068
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:05,849
Put him on my back.

1069
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:07,619
- Hurry. - What should we do?

1070
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,320
Call the police.

1071
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,630
- The police? - Do you mean call 911?

1072
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,530
- Don't touch him. - Why not?

1073
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,730
Don't touch him right now.

1074
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,860
- How could this have happened? - Don't touch him.

1075
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,369
Gosh.

Could it be the Kitty Gang's doing?

01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,239
It doesn't matter if he gets wind of what I'm up to.

1081
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,309
He's got an urgent matter to take care of.

Flashman!

1087
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,280
The agenda of the video is too obvious. I doubt she posted it.

but I'm not.
