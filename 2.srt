- Yes, Hyungnim.

One more thing, Hyungnim. She belongs to a group called...

How else would she be so skilled while playing with kids?

- Jae Su, you can go.

We need to take her spine apart, Hyungnim!

234
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,900
Hyungnim, your spine will come apart at this rate.

Get some rest, Hyungnim. We'll get going.

236

Is he a mobster or a meat processing company owner?

249
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,030
I heard it's a company by ex-cons. So, probably both?

250
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,850
I guess. I heard the mobsters pretend to run businesses.

- Broken ribs?
- Yeah, I thought he was fine, but I guess not.

She should have just played with the kids.

332
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,950
Why mess with these scary adults?

333
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,460
So much hate in the comments.

334
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,830
Feck, fick, fock, fack...

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,490
So much for acting all innocent.

341
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,680
She ended up going low to get the views.

342
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,700
When she said she was going to the festival, did she have it all planned out?

343
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,160
Who knows?

344
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,440
"I'm only thinking of the kids!"

345
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,150
Maybe she was calculating all this time.

346
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,890
If you'll talk behind someone's back, make sure no one can hear it.

347
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,350
If we can all hear it, you're saying it to their face, not their back.

348
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,490
It wasn't to her face. So what?

349
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,890
"So what"?

350
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,670
How do you know she can't hear you?

351
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,910
I didn't upload it.

352

I didn't know, either.

353

But now you do.

354
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,100
We sit around doing toy unboxing videos. Don't we look like villains to you, too?

355
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,360
Villains? Not at all.

356
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,500
Unni, you think you get to be a hero all by yourself?

357
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,450
You have to be right and everyone else wrong.

358
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,530
That's the only way you can pretend to be righteous.

359
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,970
Let's stop paying attention.

360
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,260
What's it like to see mobsters in real life?

361
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,670
Can't you tell? They pulled her hair.

362
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,460
- It might be fake.
- Who does such a poor job?

363
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,820
Must be hard to pay the bills. Risking her life to make money.

364
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,690
With this many views, it's worth risking your life.

She's a kids' creator.

373
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,330
She makes videos that kids watch.

374
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,740
Kids creator?

375
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,430
Oh, like the six-year-old who bought a building?

376
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,270

I don't know. I'm sorry.

380

Well?

381
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,480
They'll be dealing with this for a while to pay attention to Jeong Yoon Taek.

382
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,750
So what if they've caught a whiff?

No.

385
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,260
Maybe they caught a whiff of

386
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,340
their own asses burning.

387
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,080

388

They made us into villains, and what? Assault?

389
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,860
What assault? This is illegal gambling!

390
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,290
Assault and illegal gambling. Same difference.

391
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,130
Anyway, this is all because of that little rat!

392

Why do you keep yelling at him?

394

It's not the first time we've been mocked.

395

But this was a shady way to do it.

396
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,190

397
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,950
I lost sleep to make that product.

398
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,010
Not even getting judged fairly...

399
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,510
makes me sad.

400
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,400
We'll do everything we can legally.

401
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,650
But the video is already everywhere.

402
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,780
It caused serious damage to our brand even before the launch of the new product.

403
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,160
Are you sure she uploaded it?

404
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,570
It says "Minnie unni" in gigantic letters, Hyungnim.

405
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,080
She has no fear! She didn't even hide.

406
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,030
Creators make their own content.

407
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,670
I doubt it was uploaded without her consent.

408
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,780
All right...

409
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,690
Okay, I understand what you mean.

410
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,230

Taking out cameras whenever something happens.

412
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,390
Maybe she was already filming rather than filming on purpose.

413
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,790
- Posting for public view is another matter.
- But this is her job.

414
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,510
Still, I think she intended to stir controversy.

415
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,510
I don't think so.

416
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,500
If you look, it's very different from her other videos.

417
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,420
It's so provocative. I don't think she posted it.

418
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,930
You don't get it. Provocative sells. Exposing things.

419
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,160
I guess people think that. Just look at the comments.

420
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,950
Comments?

421
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,800
People aren't thinking when they comment.

422
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,860
They do it because they have fingers to move.

423
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,910
I have fingers, too.

424
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,780
Anyway, if I didn't know you, I'd think you had a crush on that unni.

425
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,980
- What?
- I know it's because you hate Thirsty Deer.

426
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,690
But it might look like you care because you like her.

427
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,170
Have you looked into Club Cat?

428
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,790
What?

429
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,390
Of course. This is why Seo Ji Hwan went to Club Cat.

430
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,400
A Thirsty Deer employee went MIA, so he went to get him.

431
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,620
Which employee? The one from Kitty Gang?

432
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,800
Pardon?

433
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,120
I didn't get that far...

434
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,460
but I should have.

Then, I'll take this one.

441
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,740
In that case, I'll do this.

Well...

We already planned to take down the video.

For someone like Minnie unni, who has few subscribers and is unpopular...
